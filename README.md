## Findings

### School size
This dataset covers a wide variety of school sizes with student bodies ranging from 171 students to 2,038 students. Chang High School, being by far the smallest, may be worth removing from the dataset, as learning conditions and budgeting at that school may affect students differently than at the other schools. Additional analysis is required. Furthermore, more research may reveal that large schools perform differently from small schools. 

### School Budgets
Public schools have a higher average budget than do charter schools. Perhaps a comparison of the per school budget to the number of students in each school will reveal important information about how public and charter schools differ.

### Math Scores
Charter school students score higher in math than do public school students in every grade level but grade 12. Public school math scores are more consistent than are charter school math scores, with the average score being 64 in every grade level but grade 11. Charter school math scores, on the other hand, start high at 70, but they find their way down to 60 by grade 12. Perhaps additional analysis should be done on the different types of math curricula at public schools versus charter schools. This type of analysis may require a new dataset entirely!
